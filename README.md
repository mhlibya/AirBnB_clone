# AirBnB Clone Project
### Description
The AirBnB Clone Project is a Python-based endeavor aimed at building a simplified version of the popular AirBnB platform. This project serves as a learning exercise and foundation for understanding various concepts in web development, including object-oriented programming, serialization, storage management, and command-line interfaces.

### Command Interpreter
The heart of the AirBnB Clone Project is its command-line interpreter, which facilitates the management of AirBnB objects. The interpreter provides a simple yet powerful interface for creating, displaying, updating, and deleting various objects within the AirBnB ecosystem.

### Usage
##### Once the command-line interpreter is running, you can perform the following operations:

* create: Create a new instance of a specified object.
* show: Display information about a specific object.
* update: Update the attributes of an existing object.
* destroy: Delete a specified object.
